Find. Big. Info. (F.B.I.) - A Python script capable of 'Reverse Search Address', 'Reverse Search Email Address' and 'Reverse Search Phone Number

(UPDATE) The Ekata API keys are now obsolete. This is sad news as I was hoping for a way to resolve this issue for you all so that F.B.I. could be used by everyone. Unfortunately, there isn't any way for this to work without the old Ekata API keys. Please continue to use this project as a reference if you are interested in creating something similar yourself.

#

**Instructions:**


**Step (1):**
`sudo git clone https://github.com/thecarpetjasp/F.B.I.`


**Step (2):**
`cd F.B.I.`


**Step (3):** **(EXPIRED)**
Go to https://ekata.com/ -- Create a free account and generate your API keys for 'Reverse Search Address', 'Reverse Search Email' and 'Reverse Search Phone Number'


**Step (4):**
`sudo nano fbi.py` Insert API keys into designated areas. Then hit `CTRL + o` & `Enter` to save. Then `CTRL + x` to exit.

**Step (5):**
`sudo python3 install.py`

# NOTES
I uploaded this repository 4 years ago, quite close to the start of my programming journey. There are noticeable inefficiencies throughout the code.

Unfortunately, as this program will no longer function without the obsolete Ekata API keys, I have decided not to refine this project.
